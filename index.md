# Welcome to the Integrator API!
The Integrator is built from the ground up as an API first platform whereby every new feature is first exposed in the API, and then shortly after in the UI.  The Integrator API is RESTful, uses JSON to pass around data, and is secured by different types of tokens.  The main audience for this API are developers that wish to build pre-built integrations between specific applications and then list those pre-integrations in the Integrator App Marketplace.  The Integrator combined with the API provides extremely rich functionality to dynamically deploy, configure, and run complex integrations in a fully managed (App type) manner.  Enjoy!
