# Integrator API
The Integrator is an API first platformâ€”whereby every new feature is released first in the API, and then shortly after in the browser, which simply invokes the API too.  The API is RESTful, uses JSON, and is secured via Bearer Tokens.  The target audience for the API is developers who wish to build fully featured, fully managed integrations between popular software applications.  Any integrations built via the API can be listed in the Integrator Marketplace for easy install by any other Integrator user. Complementing the API, the Integrator platform supports an incredibly rich customization framework.  The integrations that you build can include a custom installers, custom settings pages, along with any number of custom integration hooks (integraion hooks give you the ability to write your own custom code, and are especially useful for requirements that just can't be implemented via configuration alone).  Enjoy!
