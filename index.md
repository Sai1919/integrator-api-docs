# Integrator API
The Integrator is an API first platform.  Every new feature is developed and exposed in the API first.  The API is RESTful, uses JSON, and is secured by Bearer Tokens.  The target audience for the API is developers that wish to use the Integrator to build fully featured, fully managed integrations between popular software applications.  Any integrations built can be listed in the Integrator Marketplace for easy install by any other Integrator user. Complementing the API nicely, the Integrator platform supports a very rich customization framework.  The integrations that you build can include an installer, a settings page, along with any number of custom integration hooks (whereby your code can be used to implement the really challenging use cases).  Enjoy!
